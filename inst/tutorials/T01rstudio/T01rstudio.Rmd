As the whole course is in fact an R "package" (called `ReMUSE`), when you have it installed, you will be able to access the tutorials in the "Tutorial" tab in the panel at the top right.

These tutorials are ordered in alphabetical order, which is why we have given them a little particular names:

  * `T00tuto` for the very first one
  * `T01rstudio` for the one you are currently reading
  * `T02packages` for packages
  * `T03ggplot2` for `ggplot2`
  * `T04pheatmap` for hetmaps
